introduction: |
  This beginner blueprint demonstrates how to control an LED from the Particle Console
  using a cloud function (`setLED`). It's a simple pattern for remote control and state reporting.
description: |
  The firmware registers a cloud function `setLED` that accepts "ON", "OFF", or "TOGGLE".
  After updating the LED pin and internal state, it publishes a private `led_state` event
  with "ON" or "OFF". This approach provides both control and visibility for dashboards,
  webhooks, or other devices subscribing to the state.
